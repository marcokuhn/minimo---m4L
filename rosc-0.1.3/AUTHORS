This library is based on the original Ruby osc library by Tadayoshi Funaba
<tadf@funaba.org> which can be found at http://www.funaba.org/en/ruby.html#osc

Hans Fugal <hans@fugal.net> heavily refactored, rewrote, and to some extent
redesigned that code to produce what you have here.

Thanks to Paul Battley for the ingenious Tiger pack hack.

Thanks to Von and Jacob Fugal for various very useful contributions.

Thanks to Liam Staskawicz for some testing and bug-finding.

Thanks to Jan Krutisch for some debugging and better unit tests.
